    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz Raspberries</li>
            <li>1 lb Strawberries</li>
            <li>1 Mango</li>
            <li>1 Orange optional</li>
            <li>1 lb Green Grapes</li>
            <li>1 lb Purple Grapes</li>
            <li>14 oz Dâ€™Gari Gelatin Dessert pineapple or mango</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare fruits for the cake. Clean and cut them into equal pieces. I wouldn't recommend cutting raspberries. Note: Jello is best in mango or pineapple flavor. I found that a combination of the two works amazing together.</li>
            <li>Place raspberries, followed by strawberries. This is how the dessert will look like on the outside.</li>
            <li>Add mango, orange, and green grapes.</li>
            <li>Finish off by laying out purple grapes. Dissolve jello in hot water, following instructions on the box. Let the jello mixture cool competently.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour in the mixture over the fruits. Shake the tray a little, so it goes through all the sides. Cover the fruit competently with the jello.</li>
            <li>Leave it refrigerated until completely set, for about 2 hours. In order to remove it from the tray, pour hot water into a large bowl, and place the dish into it. As soon as you see a little bit of melting on the sides, cover the jello with a serving plate and turn it over. If necessary, wipe off the sides around the jello.</li>
            <li>Return to the refrigerator to keep it cold, until ready to serve. I would only remove the cake from tray a few hours before serving.</li>
        </ol>
