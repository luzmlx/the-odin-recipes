# the-odin-recipes

This project will have a list of dessert recipes for you to 
read and make tasty desserts

While I do have previous knowledge on HTML, I decided to try 
the Odin Project to give myself the motivation I needed to get 
back into coding seriously. My knowledge of HTML will allow me to effectively showcase my skills. I am staying true to the Odin Project and will only use HTML, no CSS or JS.
