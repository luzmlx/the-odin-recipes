    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 tablespoons of salted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar (I like to use raw cane sugar with a coarser texture)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>3/4 cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid form.</li>
        <li>Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated – 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).</li>
        <li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden.</li>
        <li>Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so</li>
    </ol>
